I discovered the exceptional potential of Spark AR, an innovative tool that merges reality with virtual elements. Recognizing its vast possibilities, I resolved to employ this technology to enhance the NDP experience and evoke a deep emotional connection among viewers."},{"key":"Planning and ideation","text":"Embarking on this project required meticulous planning and creative ideation. In consultation with mentors and elders, I envisioned a distinctive concept that could foster interactive engagement and embody the NDP\'s core values. Ultimately, I conceived an AR filter that enabled users to virtually rain Singaporean flags down on their faces."},{"key":"Implementation and Overcoming Challenges","text":"The implementation phase proved thrilling and challenging. Equipped with the SPARK AR interface, I embarked on the intricate process of designing and developing the augmented reality filter. Utilizing my burgeoning skills in 3D modelling and an astute comprehension of the SPARK AR platform, I was able to breathe life into virtual flags with the utmost precision. However, this journey was not without obstacles. Challenges surfaced, demanding determination and adaptability. Primarily, optimizing filter performance while ensuring compatibility across various devices proved daunting. Striking a delicate balance between visual fidelity and seamless interactivity necessitated meticulous calibration and continuous refinement. Through countless iterations and perseverance, I successfully surmounted these technical hurdles."},{"key":"Testing and Iteration","text":"To ensure filter efficacy, a rigorous testing phase ensued. Collaborating with peers, educators, and family, I sought feedback to enhance the user experience and address any unforeseen issues. The invaluable insights gleaned from these testing sessions provided a roadmap for iterative improvements. This enabled me to fine-tune the filter\'s functionality and rectify any discrepancies."},{"key":"Launch and reception","text":"With unwavering commitment and cooperation from my peers and educators, the Singapore NDP project on SPARK AR was unveiled. I disseminated information about the AR filter, generating anticipation and excitement within the community. The filter was entered into a nationwide competition but did not win."},{"key":"Conclusion","text":"My journey in creating a Singapore NDP project on SPARK AR has been an enriching experience, infused with challenges and triumphs. Through meticulous planning, technical implementation, and unwavering determination, I contributed to our nation\'s cherished NDP celebrations. This project not only broadened my technical skills but also instilled a profound sense of pride and responsibility towards preserving our cultural heritage. Looking ahead, I am inspired to explore the further possibilities offered by augmented reality and continue contributing to Singapore\'s vibrant innovation tapestry. As a diligent primary six student, I remain committed to pursuing endeavours that embody the spirit of unity. This will instil in me a lasting appreciation for our remarkable nation\'s harmonious diversity."}]},{"img_src":"images/scratch2.JPG","images":["images/scratch2.JPG","images/scratch3.JPG"],"title":"A Journey Through Scratch","details":[{"key":"Journey","text":"In 2019, as part of my educational pursuits, I enrolled in a Scratch coding course and completed it in 2020. My interest in Scratch sparked a self-driven exploration that led me to independently progress beyond a beginner\'s level in coding."},{"key":"Accomplishments","text":"During my journey, I\'ve accomplished several projects including \'Gratitude in 60 seconds\' (an animation), \'Market Trade\' (a multiplayer game), and \'GP Game\' (a clicker game)."},{"key":"Challenges","text":"I faced several challenges along the way. These included brain blocks and conflicts between different blocks of code."},{"key":"Reflections","text":"Scratch served as my gateway to coding. Despite the challenges, I believe that every achievement comes with its own hurdles. My journey is far from over, and I continue to make new friends, overcome obstacles, and create lasting memories. I am excited to continue growing and pursuing my dreams."}]},{"img_src":"images/gpt.gif","images":["images/gpt.gif","images/python1.JPG"],"title":"My Python Journey","details":[{"key":"Learning the basics","text":"When I started, I learned the basic things about Python, like variables (which are like containers for information), data types (like numbers and words), and loops (which let you repeat things). I also learned about conditional statements, which help the computer make decisions."},{"key":"Learning the advanced","text":"After I got comfortable with the basics, I went deeper into Python and learned about things like functions, which are like mini-programs that can do specific tasks. I also learned about object-oriented programming, which is a way to organize and structure code so it\'s easier to work with. Another thing I explored was file handling, which is how the computer reads and writes information from files."},{"key":"My skills put into use","text":"Once I had a good understanding of Python, I decided to use my knowledge to make games. Game development became my focus, and I learned about game loops (which make games keep running), sprites (which are like characters or objects in a game), and collision detection (which checks if things in the game hit each other)."},{"key":"An example","text":"One game I made was Tic-Tac-Toe, which many may have played before. First, I thought about how the game should work and drew a picture of the game board. I figured out the rules for winning and planned out the different things the game needed to do."},{"key":"Coding the game","text":"Then came the fun part: writing the code to make the Tic-Tac-Toe game work! I used the concepts of object-oriented programming to create different parts of the game, like the game board and the players. I wrote code to show the game board, let players take turns, check for a winner, and prevent invalid moves. It was challenging, but I kept trying until everything worked correctly."},{"key":"Checking my code","text":"I tested the game a lot to find and fix any problems. I asked my friends and other programmers to try it out and give me feedback. Their suggestions helped me make the game easier to understand, more fun, and without any mistakes. I also made sure the game looked nice and ran smoothly."},{"key":"End product","text":"Finally, after a lot of learning, coding, and improving, I finished my Tic-Tac-Toe game! I felt really proud of what I had accomplished. I shared the game with others, and they had fun playing it. Creating this game taught me important things like not giving up when things get tough, finding solutions to problems, and always being willing to learn more."},{"key":"My reflection","text":"Now that I\'ve completed this project, I\'m excited to take on even bigger programming challenges. I\'m ready to explore new areas of software development and keep growing as a programmer. Just like a journey with thousands of steps, every little step in learning programming is important, and I\'ve enjoyed every part of it. As Pamela Cummins, a spiritual growth intuitive, once wrote: \'Every journey starts with the first step and the thousands upon thousands steps before you reach the end. Enjoy every step.\'"}]}]');const
